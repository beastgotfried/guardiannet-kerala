#  GuardianNet (Kerala Edition)

> **Hyper-local resilience for the Western Ghats.** Built to ensure that the nearest help is always connected, even when the grid fails.

##  Key Features

*   **Interactive Crisis Mapping:** Real-time visualization of incident zones (e.g., Mundakkai, Chooralmala) with Leaflet-based tracking.
*   **Verified Responder Mesh:** A tactical directory of local talent—drone pilots for high-altitude search, excavator operators for debris clearance, and medical strike teams.
*   **Off-Grid Coordination:** Integrated mesh networking protocols (BLE/Web Mesh) to maintain communication when the central grid is down.
*   **KSDMA Control Center:** Live dashboard for state-level oversight, tracking rainfall, wind speed, and risk indices.
